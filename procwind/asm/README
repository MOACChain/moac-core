Contracts
ChainBaseASM.sol         - AppChain definition contract, SCS calls this contract to form the AppChain;
DappBasePrivate.sol      - DappControl contract only allows the AppChain owner to deploy DAPPs, 
                           should be the first contract deployed after MicorChain is running, 
                           to handle multiple contracts, required after Nuwa 1.0.9;
DappBasePublic.sol       - DappControl contract allows other users to deploy DAPP than the AppChain owner,
                           should be the first contract deployed after MicorChain is running, 
                           to handle multiple contracts, required after Nuwa 1.0.9;
DappBasePrivate_0.5.sol  - DappControl contract for solidity compiler 0.5.x, this needs to be deployed separately with 
                           solidity 0.5.x compiler;
DappBasePublic_0.5.sol   - DappControl contract for solidity compiler 0.5.x, this needs to be deployed separately with 
                           solidity 0.5.x compiler;
SCSProtocolBase.sol      - AppChain definition contract for SCS pool, SCS calls this contract to 
                           register/withdraw from the AppChain.
VNODEProtocolBase.sol    - AppChain definition protocol for VNODE pool, VNODE calls this contract to 
                           register/withdraw the AppChain and handle the traffic of AppChain to the BaseChain network.

Scripts
deployASM.js             - Example JS script to deploy the ASM AppChain on the AppChain;
deployDappBase.js        - Example JS script to deploy the Dappbase on the AppChain;
deployDapp.js            - Example JS script to deploy Dapp on the AppChain after Dappbase is deployed;
callDappExample.js       - Example JS script to call AppChain and Dappbase functions;
closeASM.js              - Example JS script to close a deployed ASM AppChain;
crossASM.js              - Example JS script to perform cross chain functions between AppChain and BaseChain;
mcABIs.js                - ABIs for AST, ASM and DappBase, used by callDappExample;
