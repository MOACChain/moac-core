README              - Helpful info about the files in the package;
DappBasePrivate.sol - DappControl contract only allows the AppChain owner to deploy DAPPs, 
                      should be the first contract deployed after MicorChain is running, 
                      to handle multiple contracts, required after Nuwa 1.0.9;
DappBasePublic.sol  - DappControl contract allows other users to deploy DAPP than the AppChain owner,
                      should be the first contract deployed after MicorChain is running, 
                      to handle multiple contracts, required after Nuwa 1.0.9;
deployAST.js     - Example javascript file to be used to deploy the AST AppChain;
mcABIs.js        - File contains ABI info for AST, ASM and DappBase;
erc20.sol        - Example ERC20 contract, should be deployed before the AST AppChain to enable the AST;
ChainBaseAST.sol         - AppChain definition contract, SCS calls this contract to form the AppChain;
SubChainProtocolBase.sol - AppChain definition protocol for SCS, SCS calls this contract to register/withdraw from the AppChain.
VnodeProtocolBase.sol    - AppChain definition protocol for VNODE, VNODE calls this contract to register/withdraw the AppChain and handle the traffic of AppChain to the MotherChain network.
