Contracts
SCSProtocolBase.sol      - AppChain definition contract for SCS pool, SCS calls this contract to 
                           register/withdraw from the AppChain.
VNODEProtocolBase.sol    - AppChain definition protocol for VNODE pool, VNODE calls this contract to 
                           register/withdraw the AppChain and handle the traffic of AppChain to the BaseChain network.
VssBase.sol              - System smart contract for verifiable secret sharing, required by RandDrop AppChain contract.
RanddropChainBaseASM.sol - RandDrop AppChain contract, SCS calls this contract to form the AppChain;
DappBasePrivate.sol      - DappControl contract only allows the AppChain owner to deploy DAPPs, 
                           should be the first contract deployed after MicorChain is running, 
                           to handle multiple contracts, required after Nuwa 1.0.9;
DappBasePublic.sol       - DappControl contract allows other users to deploy DAPP than the AppChain owner,
                           should be the first contract deployed after MicorChain is running, 
                           to handle multiple contracts, required after Nuwa 1.0.9;
test.sol                 - Example contract file;
